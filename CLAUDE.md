# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project status

Early scaffold for the `@przeprogramowani/10x-cli`. Most commands are deliberate stubs that exit via `exitNotImplemented` and reference the phase in which they land. The full roadmap lives at `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-04-07-10x-cli-design.md` (in the sibling `10x-toolkit` repo, not in this one). When asked to implement something, check that plan first to understand which phase the work belongs to and what envelope/exit-code conventions apply.

## Commands

Runtime is **Bun** (≥ Node 20 declared in `package.json` for the published binary, but local dev uses Bun directly).

```bash
bun install
bun run dev -- <args>      # run CLI from source, e.g. `bun run dev -- --help`
bun run typecheck          # tsc --noEmit
bun run lint               # oxlint (config in .oxlintrc.json)
bun test                   # bun:test runner; tests live in tests/
bun test tests/smoke.test.ts   # single file
bun run build              # node-target ESM bundle → dist/index.mjs
bun run build:binary       # standalone compiled binary → dist/10x (~59MB)
bun run generate-types     # refetch /openapi.json → src/generated/api-types.ts
```

`generate-types` hits the production delivery API by default. To regenerate against a local backend: `API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8787 bun run generate-types`. The same env var is read at CLI runtime by `resolveApiBase()` to point the CLI at a non-production API. **The allowlist is strict**: only the exact production host or `http://localhost` / `http://127.0.0.1` (any port) are accepted — any other URL throws and exits 2. If you need a staging host, add it explicitly to `PROD_HOSTNAME` / `DEV_HOSTNAMES` in `src/lib/api-client.ts`.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck → lint → test → build → build:binary on every PR. Anything that breaks one of those steps will block merge.

## Architecture

The CLI is a thin **CAC**-based command dispatcher (`src/index.ts`) that wires command modules into a single `cac("10x")` instance and parses argv. Three concerns are factored into `src/lib/`:

- **`api-client.ts`** — typed `fetch` wrapper for the 10x-toolkit delivery API. Returns a discriminated `ApiResult<T>` (`{ ok: true, data }` | `{ ok: false, code, error }`) — callers **must** branch on `ok` and surface failures via `outputError`. Network errors collapse to `code: "network_error"`, status `0`. The HTTP surface is described by `src/generated/api-types.ts`, which is generated from `/openapi.json` and committed to git; never hand-edit it.
- **`config.ts`** — XDG-compliant local credential store at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/10x-cli/auth.json` (Windows: `%APPDATA%/10x-cli/auth.json`). `saveAuth` writes atomically via `tmp` + `renameSync` with mode `0o600`, and `AuthData` is versioned (`AUTH_FILE_VERSION = 1`) — bumping the schema means bumping the version and handling the older payload in `readAuth`.
- **`output.ts`** — the I/O contract every command must follow. Three rules to internalize:
  1. **Stdout is reserved for data; humans read stderr.** `output()` writes JSON to stdout *or* a human message to stderr — never both.
  2. **JSON mode is implied when stdout is not a TTY**, even without `--json`. `resolveContext()` handles this; commands should always go through it instead of checking flags directly.
  3. **Exit codes are semantic** (`ExitCodes`): `0` SUCCESS, `1` ERROR, `2` USAGE, `3` AUTH_REQUIRED, `4` FORBIDDEN, `5` NOT_FOUND. Use `outputError(ctx, code, message, exitCode, hint)` rather than `process.exit` ad-hoc, so the JSON envelope `{ status: "error", error: { code, message, hint } }` stays consistent.

- **`conflict-prompt.ts`** — interactive conflict resolution for user-edited files. `createConflictResolver(tty)` returns a `ConflictResolver` callback injected into `applyBundle()`. TTY mode shows a per-file `@clack/prompts` select with overwrite / save-as-.user / skip / apply-to-all options. Non-TTY mode returns `"skip"` unconditionally — user work is never silently destroyed in pipelines.

Each command in `src/commands/` exports a `register*Command(cli)` function that attaches itself to the shared CAC instance. Adding a new command means: create `src/commands/foo.ts` exporting `registerFooCommand`, import + call it in `src/index.ts`. Action callbacks receive their positional args followed by an options object that already includes the global `--json` / `--verbose` flags — pass that object straight into `resolveContext` / `outputError`.

Stub commands intentionally call `exitNotImplemented(name, phase, options)` so machine consumers still get a parseable error envelope. When implementing a phase, replace that call rather than working around it.

## Testing

- Test runner: `bun test` (not vitest, not Jest)
- Imports: `import { describe, it, expect, mock } from "bun:test"`
- Module mocks: use `mock.module()` from `bun:test`, not `vi.mock`
- Prefer dependency injection over module mocking where possible
- Run tests with `bun test`, not `vitest run` or `npx jest`

## Writer & conflict detection

`applyBundle()` in `writer.ts` is **async** and accepts an optional `onConflict: ConflictResolver` callback via `ApplyOptions`. The writer uses three-way hash comparison to detect user-edited files:

- The manifest (v3) stores per-file SHA-256 content hashes (`contentHashes` for skills, `promptHashes` for prompts).
- On re-apply, if local content differs from both the stored hash and the new bundle content, it's a user edit → the `onConflict` callback is invoked.
- If local content differs from the stored hash but matches the new content → `"unchanged"` (no conflict).
- If local content matches the stored hash → clean upstream update, no conflict.
- When no `onConflict` callback is provided, conflicts default to `"skip"` (safe).
- Manifest v2 (no hashes) is accepted at read time; any content difference on first apply triggers a conflict prompt (one-time calibration). After resolution, v3 hashes are stored.

`WriteResult` includes a `removals` field tracking files deleted during lesson-scoped cleanup. These render as `[removed]` lines in human output and appear in the JSON envelope under `writes.removals` with `counts.removals`.

Conflict actions: `"conflict_overwritten"` | `"conflict_saved_user"` (creates `.user.<ext>` backup) | `"conflict_skipped"` (preserves local, does NOT update manifest hash so conflict re-triggers on next apply).

`applyBundle` takes an `applyCourseRules?: boolean` (default `true`). When `false`, the course rules block (the `@przeprogramowani/10x-cli` sentinel section) is not written and any existing one is **stripped** from the rules file (surrounding content preserved, `rules.action: "removed"`). The CLI exposes this via `--no-course-rules` / `--course-rules` on `get`, persists the choice as `courseRules` in `config.json` (merge-safe via `updateToolConfig`), and resolves it tri-state — argv flag > persisted config > default-on (CAC can't distinguish default-on from explicit `--course-rules`, hence the argv peek in `resolveCourseRulesFlag`). An explicit `--type rules` request forces apply regardless of the setting. Rules are sentinel-based, not manifest-tracked, so opting out needs no manifest changes.

## Cumulative manifest & lesson-scoped removal

The manifest is **cumulative** — each `10x get` accumulates artifacts across lessons instead of replacing them. The manifest's `lessons` field (`Record<string, LessonFilesEntry>`) tracks per-lesson file ownership:

- Each lesson entry records its skills, prompts, configs, and an `appliedAt` timestamp.
- The `files` field is a **union** of all lesson entries, rebuilt on each apply via `buildUnionFiles()`. Content hashes in `files` reflect what's on disk (current bundle's hashes win, others preserved from previous manifest).
- `computeRemovals()` is **scoped to the current lesson**: it only removes files that (a) were in this lesson's previous entry, (b) are absent from the new bundle, and (c) are not claimed by any other lesson (the "protected set").
- `lessonId` is the last-applied lesson (for display/backward compat). `Object.keys(manifest.lessons)` gives all applied lesson IDs.
- Upgrading from v2 or v3-without-`lessons` seeds the `lessons` record from the previous manifest's `lessonId` + `files` data so existing artifacts aren't orphaned.

## `10x sync` & change detection

`commands/sync.ts` is the bulk download + update command. It enumerates unlocked lessons in one `fetchCatalog` call, applies each via `applyBundle`, and emits one aggregate report — it **never `process.exit`s mid-loop** (per-lesson failures accumulate; exit code is worst-outcome, `1` only if a lesson errored) and **never prompts** (default conflict resolver skips, `--force` overwrites).

- **Cheap-skip is digest-vs-digest.** The catalog advertises a per-lesson `contentHash` (`LessonSummary.contentHash`, optional). On apply, sync stores that exact value into `manifest.lessons[id].catalogContentHash` (via `ApplyOptions.catalogContentHash`). Next sync compares the *new catalog digest* against the *stored* one and skips the fetch entirely when equal. Never compare the catalog digest against the writer's per-file hashes — they live in a different hash space. Absent digest (older backend) or absent stored value → always-fetch fallback. `--force` bypasses the gate so it can overwrite local edits even when upstream is unchanged.
- **`planBundle()` is the pure planner.** It classifies per-file `{ action, isConflict, upstreamChanged }` without writing or prompting; `applyBundle` consumes it so classification and application can't diverge. `sync --dry-run` reports off `planBundle`; the real path reports off `applyBundle`'s `WriteResult`. The parity is locked by `tests/writer-plan.test.ts`.
- **Change visibility is skills + prompts only.** Configs are create-only (never overwritten, so nothing to report) and rules are sentinel-managed, not manifest-hash-tracked.
- A plain `10x get` neither refreshes nor erases a stored `catalogContentHash` (it's carried forward in `applyBundle`), so at worst one redundant fetch never happens.

## Conventions worth knowing

- TypeScript is `strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + `noImplicitOverride`. Index access on arrays/records returns `T | undefined` — handle it.
- Generated code lives under `src/generated/` and is excluded from oxlint via `.oxlintrc.json`.
- The CAC parser throws on unknown options; `src/index.ts` catches that and exits `2` (USAGE) with an `ERROR usage:` prefix on stderr. Preserve this behavior — it's how scripts detect bad invocations.
- The CLI's user-agent is hard-coded to `"10x-cli"` in `api-client.ts`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit — Module 1, Lesson 2

Pick a starter and a stack for the PRD you wrote in Lesson 1, with the **stack chain**:

```
(/10x-init  →  /10x-shape  →  /10x-prd)  →  /10x-tech-stack-selector  →  (bootstrapper)
```

The PRD chain ships from Lesson 1 (re-included in this lesson so you can fix the PRD mid-flight). `/10x-tech-stack-selector` is the lesson's main topic; `/10x-bootstrapper` is the next link, taught in Lesson 3.

### Task Router — Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Stack selection (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-tech-stack-selector` | You have a PRD at `context/foundation/prd.md` and need to pick a starter. Opens with an explicit choice (take the recommended default for your `(product_type, language_family)` cell, or design your own), walks the follow-up question set when you design your own, applies four agent-friendly quality gates, reasons over the language-aware starter registry, and writes `context/foundation/tech-stack.md`. Optional `[path-to-prd]` argument lets you point at a non-default PRD location (e.g., `/10x-tech-stack-selector @context/foundation/prd-v2.md`); without it the skill defaults to `context/foundation/prd.md`. Use AFTER `/10x-prd`, BEFORE `/10x-bootstrapper`. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-init` / `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` | Bundled so you can fix the PRD mid-flight. If `/10x-tech-stack-selector` surfaces a gap (e.g., a Functional Requirement that forces a feature your recommended starter doesn't carry), re-run `/10x-prd` to amend the PRD before the stack pick. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-tech-stack-selector` reads `context/foundation/prd.md` frontmatter (`product_type`, `target_scale`, `timeline_budget`) as priors. If the PRD is absent, it refuses with a one-sentence redirect to `/10x-shape` — no inline mini-PRD fallback.
- The skill writes `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` with a 4-key frontmatter (`starter_id`, `package_manager`, `project_name`, `hints`) plus a one-paragraph `## Why this stack` body. The hand-off is intentionally minimal — bootstrapper does not parse rationale, only fields.
- `/10x-bootstrapper` (Lesson 3) reads `tech-stack.md` and the registry to scaffold the project.

### What tech-stack-selector captures (and what it does NOT)

- **Captured**: starter pick (registry-shaped), language family, package manager (open string per ecosystem — `pnpm`, `uv`, `bundle`, `cargo`, etc.), team size, deployment target (drawn from the chosen starter's `deployment_defaults`), CI/CD provider + flow, bootstrapper confidence (`verified | first-class | best-effort`), path taken (standard | custom), self-check answers (custom path), quality override (set when the user proceeds with a starter that failed ≥1 agent-friendly gate), feature flags (auth/payments/realtime/AI/background-jobs).
- **NOT captured (deliberate)**: strategic test plan, strategic deployment plan, strategic implementation decisions. Those are downstream of stack selection — a future technical-roadmap concern, not yet planned. Tech-stack-selector owns *framework-shaped* test/deploy/CI choices because those are inseparable from stack pick; what defers is the *strategic* layer ("we TDD on X surface", "preview environment per PR").

### The opening choice (load-bearing)

The first question is an explicit choice — never silent. The skill names the recommended starter for your `(product_type, language_family)` cell up front and asks for explicit confirmation:

- **Standard path** — accept the recommended default. The skill skips the feature audit, team profile, tech preferences, and framework-variant questions; it asks only the deployment, CI/CD, and project-name questions. The hand-off records `path_taken: standard` under `hints`.
- **Custom path** — design your own. The skill walks the full follow-up set (feature audit, team profile, tech preferences, deployment, CI/CD, framework variant), drills into a testing-runner question only when the chosen starter leaves it ambiguous, and closes with a 5-point readiness self-check (from prework lesson 4.1) before locking in. The hand-off records `path_taken: custom` and populates `self_check_answers`.

The recommended-default-per-cell map is multi-language: web/JS and saas/JS both → 10x-astro-starter (the 10x-branded starter leads whenever it competes in a JS cell); api/JS → hono; api/Python → fastapi; web/Python → django; web/Ruby → rails; api/Go → go; api/Rust → axum; mobile/Dart → flutter; desktop/Rust → tauri; etc. Cells with no vetted default carry `<none>` and force the custom path.

### Quality gates (agent-friendly criteria)

Every starter card carries four booleans the LLM filters against:

1. **Typed** — explicit types/schemas the agent can reason from without running the program.
2. **Convention-based** — strong opinions on layout, routing, configuration.
3. **Popular in training data** — assessed *per language family*, not globally (Django is popular within Python training data; Spring within Java; etc.).
4. **Well-documented** — current, version-pinned, link-able docs.

Candidates failing any gate are excluded from the unprompted recommendation set. If you explicitly name a failing starter as your preference, the skill challenges that pick — surfacing the strongest higher-criteria alternative AND the compensation path (CLAUDE.md instructions that patch the gaps) — and asks you to confirm or pivot. Confirming the known-friction pick records the override on the hand-off so bootstrapper can adjust.

### Bootstrapper confidence

Every recommendation surfaces `bootstrapper_confidence` verbatim — never silently elided:

- **`verified`** — bootstrapper has been run end-to-end on this stack; scaffolding will be smooth.
- **`first-class`** — registered with a valid CLI, expected to work but not battle-tested; expect mostly-smooth scaffolding with occasional manual steps.
- **`best-effort`** — limited support; manual steps likely; expect friction (and bootstrapper's CLAUDE.md generation compensates with extra ecosystem-specific context).

This is the heads-up before running `/10x-bootstrapper` so you know what to expect.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/prd.md` — input (from Lesson 1)
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — output (the chain hand-off)
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` — recurring rules & pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` — load-bearing names registry

### Universal language

The shipped skill carries no 10xDevs / cohort / certification references. The recommended-default registry is multi-language (JS, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, Rust, PHP, .NET, Dart) and the cohort's `10x-astro-starter` is one card in the JS+web cell — not "the" recommended path for everyone.

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
