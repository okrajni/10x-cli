# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project status

Early scaffold for the `@przeprogramowani/10x-cli`. Most commands are deliberate stubs that exit via `exitNotImplemented` and reference the phase in which they land. The full roadmap lives at `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-04-07-10x-cli-design.md` (in the sibling `10x-toolkit` repo, not in this one). When asked to implement something, check that plan first to understand which phase the work belongs to and what envelope/exit-code conventions apply.

## Commands

Runtime is **Bun** (≥ Node 20 declared in `package.json` for the published binary, but local dev uses Bun directly).

```bash
bun install
bun run dev -- <args>      # run CLI from source, e.g. `bun run dev -- --help`
bun run typecheck          # tsc --noEmit
bun run lint               # oxlint (config in .oxlintrc.json)
bun test                   # bun:test runner; tests live in tests/
bun test tests/smoke.test.ts   # single file
bun run build              # node-target ESM bundle → dist/index.mjs
bun run build:binary       # standalone compiled binary → dist/10x (~59MB)
bun run generate-types     # refetch /openapi.json → src/generated/api-types.ts
```

`generate-types` hits the production delivery API by default. To regenerate against a local backend: `API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8787 bun run generate-types`. The same env var is read at CLI runtime by `resolveApiBase()` to point the CLI at a non-production API. **The allowlist is strict**: only the exact production host or `http://localhost` / `http://127.0.0.1` (any port) are accepted — any other URL throws and exits 2. If you need a staging host, add it explicitly to `PROD_HOSTNAME` / `DEV_HOSTNAMES` in `src/lib/api-client.ts`.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck → lint → test → build → build:binary on every PR. Anything that breaks one of those steps will block merge.

## Architecture

The CLI is a thin **CAC**-based command dispatcher (`src/index.ts`) that wires command modules into a single `cac("10x")` instance and parses argv. Three concerns are factored into `src/lib/`:

- **`api-client.ts`** — typed `fetch` wrapper for the 10x-toolkit delivery API. Returns a discriminated `ApiResult<T>` (`{ ok: true, data }` | `{ ok: false, code, error }`) — callers **must** branch on `ok` and surface failures via `outputError`. Network errors collapse to `code: "network_error"`, status `0`. The HTTP surface is described by `src/generated/api-types.ts`, which is generated from `/openapi.json` and committed to git; never hand-edit it.
- **`config.ts`** — XDG-compliant local credential store at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/10x-cli/auth.json` (Windows: `%APPDATA%/10x-cli/auth.json`). `saveAuth` writes atomically via `tmp` + `renameSync` with mode `0o600`, and `AuthData` is versioned (`AUTH_FILE_VERSION = 1`) — bumping the schema means bumping the version and handling the older payload in `readAuth`.
- **`output.ts`** — the I/O contract every command must follow. Three rules to internalize:
  1. **Stdout is reserved for data; humans read stderr.** `output()` writes JSON to stdout *or* a human message to stderr — never both.
  2. **JSON mode is implied when stdout is not a TTY**, even without `--json`. `resolveContext()` handles this; commands should always go through it instead of checking flags directly.
  3. **Exit codes are semantic** (`ExitCodes`): `0` SUCCESS, `1` ERROR, `2` USAGE, `3` AUTH_REQUIRED, `4` FORBIDDEN, `5` NOT_FOUND. Use `outputError(ctx, code, message, exitCode, hint)` rather than `process.exit` ad-hoc, so the JSON envelope `{ status: "error", error: { code, message, hint } }` stays consistent.

- **`conflict-prompt.ts`** — interactive conflict resolution for user-edited files. `createConflictResolver(tty)` returns a `ConflictResolver` callback injected into `applyBundle()`. TTY mode shows a per-file `@clack/prompts` select with overwrite / save-as-.user / skip / apply-to-all options. Non-TTY mode returns `"skip"` unconditionally — user work is never silently destroyed in pipelines.

Each command in `src/commands/` exports a `register*Command(cli)` function that attaches itself to the shared CAC instance. Adding a new command means: create `src/commands/foo.ts` exporting `registerFooCommand`, import + call it in `src/index.ts`. Action callbacks receive their positional args followed by an options object that already includes the global `--json` / `--verbose` flags — pass that object straight into `resolveContext` / `outputError`.

Stub commands intentionally call `exitNotImplemented(name, phase, options)` so machine consumers still get a parseable error envelope. When implementing a phase, replace that call rather than working around it.

## Testing

- Test runner: `bun test` (not vitest, not Jest)
- Imports: `import { describe, it, expect, mock } from "bun:test"`
- Module mocks: use `mock.module()` from `bun:test`, not `vi.mock`
- Prefer dependency injection over module mocking where possible
- Run tests with `bun test`, not `vitest run` or `npx jest`

## Writer & conflict detection

`applyBundle()` in `writer.ts` is **async** and accepts an optional `onConflict: ConflictResolver` callback via `ApplyOptions`. The writer uses three-way hash comparison to detect user-edited files:

- The manifest (v3) stores per-file SHA-256 content hashes (`contentHashes` for skills, `promptHashes` for prompts).
- On re-apply, if local content differs from both the stored hash and the new bundle content, it's a user edit → the `onConflict` callback is invoked.
- If local content differs from the stored hash but matches the new content → `"unchanged"` (no conflict).
- If local content matches the stored hash → clean upstream update, no conflict.
- When no `onConflict` callback is provided, conflicts default to `"skip"` (safe).
- Manifest v2 (no hashes) is accepted at read time; any content difference on first apply triggers a conflict prompt (one-time calibration). After resolution, v3 hashes are stored.

`WriteResult` includes a `removals` field tracking files deleted during lesson-scoped cleanup. These render as `[removed]` lines in human output and appear in the JSON envelope under `writes.removals` with `counts.removals`.

Conflict actions: `"conflict_overwritten"` | `"conflict_saved_user"` (creates `.user.<ext>` backup) | `"conflict_skipped"` (preserves local, does NOT update manifest hash so conflict re-triggers on next apply).

`applyBundle` takes an `applyCourseRules?: boolean` (default `true`). When `false`, the course rules block (the `@przeprogramowani/10x-cli` sentinel section) is not written and any existing one is **stripped** from the rules file (surrounding content preserved, `rules.action: "removed"`). The CLI exposes this via `--no-course-rules` / `--course-rules` on `get`, persists the choice as `courseRules` in `config.json` (merge-safe via `updateToolConfig`), and resolves it tri-state — argv flag > persisted config > default-on (CAC can't distinguish default-on from explicit `--course-rules`, hence the argv peek in `resolveCourseRulesFlag`). An explicit `--type rules` request forces apply regardless of the setting. Rules are sentinel-based, not manifest-tracked, so opting out needs no manifest changes.

## Cumulative manifest & lesson-scoped removal

The manifest is **cumulative** — each `10x get` accumulates artifacts across lessons instead of replacing them. The manifest's `lessons` field (`Record<string, LessonFilesEntry>`) tracks per-lesson file ownership:

- Each lesson entry records its skills, prompts, configs, and an `appliedAt` timestamp.
- The `files` field is a **union** of all lesson entries, rebuilt on each apply via `buildUnionFiles()`. Content hashes in `files` reflect what's on disk (current bundle's hashes win, others preserved from previous manifest).
- `computeRemovals()` is **scoped to the current lesson**: it only removes files that (a) were in this lesson's previous entry, (b) are absent from the new bundle, and (c) are not claimed by any other lesson (the "protected set").
- `lessonId` is the last-applied lesson (for display/backward compat). `Object.keys(manifest.lessons)` gives all applied lesson IDs.
- Upgrading from v2 or v3-without-`lessons` seeds the `lessons` record from the previous manifest's `lessonId` + `files` data so existing artifacts aren't orphaned.

## `10x sync` & change detection

`commands/sync.ts` is the bulk download + update command. It enumerates unlocked lessons in one `fetchCatalog` call, applies each via `applyBundle`, and emits one aggregate report — it **never `process.exit`s mid-loop** (per-lesson failures accumulate; exit code is worst-outcome, `1` only if a lesson errored) and **never prompts** (default conflict resolver skips, `--force` overwrites).

- **Cheap-skip is digest-vs-digest.** The catalog advertises a per-lesson `contentHash` (`LessonSummary.contentHash`, optional). On apply, sync stores that exact value into `manifest.lessons[id].catalogContentHash` (via `ApplyOptions.catalogContentHash`). Next sync compares the *new catalog digest* against the *stored* one and skips the fetch entirely when equal. Never compare the catalog digest against the writer's per-file hashes — they live in a different hash space. Absent digest (older backend) or absent stored value → always-fetch fallback. `--force` bypasses the gate so it can overwrite local edits even when upstream is unchanged.
- **`planBundle()` is the pure planner.** It classifies per-file `{ action, isConflict, upstreamChanged }` without writing or prompting; `applyBundle` consumes it so classification and application can't diverge. `sync --dry-run` reports off `planBundle`; the real path reports off `applyBundle`'s `WriteResult`. The parity is locked by `tests/writer-plan.test.ts`.
- **Change visibility is skills + prompts only.** Configs are create-only (never overwritten, so nothing to report) and rules are sentinel-managed, not manifest-hash-tracked.
- A plain `10x get` neither refreshes nor erases a stored `catalogContentHash` (it's carried forward in `applyBundle`), so at worst one redundant fetch never happens.

## Conventions worth knowing

- TypeScript is `strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + `noImplicitOverride`. Index access on arrays/records returns `T | undefined` — handle it.
- Generated code lives under `src/generated/` and is excluded from oxlint via `.oxlintrc.json`.
- The CAC parser throws on unknown options; `src/index.ts` catches that and exits `2` (USAGE) with an `ERROR usage:` prefix on stderr. Preserve this behavior — it's how scripts detect bad invocations.
- The CLI's user-agent is hard-coded to `"10x-cli"` in `api-client.ts`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 3

Lesson 3 is about **hooks** — turning the quality gates from Lesson 1 and the tests from Lesson 2 into automatic, deterministic checks that fire while the agent works. A hook runs outside the model, so it survives context compression, instruction changes, and the model "forgetting". The payoff for agentic hooks specifically: a `PostToolUse` check can feed its result back into the agent's context, so the agent fixes trivial errors (formatting, a missing import, a wrong type) on its own in the next iteration instead of you discovering them minutes later.

```

```

### Task Router — Which layer for this check

| You want to | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| React the instant the agent edits a file | A per-edit hook (`PostToolUse` matcher `Write\|Edit` in Claude Code). Right for fast checks: lint/format, and scoped tests on risk-area files. This is the **only** layer that can hand feedback to the agent mid-session. |
| Run only the tests that depend on the edited file | Parse the path from the hook's stdin (`jq -r .tool_input.file_path`) and run your runner's related-tests mode (`vitest related "$FILE" --run`, `jest --findRelatedTests $FILE`). Gate it on whether the file is a risk area in `test-plan.md`; don't run tests on every helper or config edit. |
| Catch changes that bypassed the agent (manual edits, a teammate's commit) | A pre-commit git hook (Lefthook or Husky+lint-staged) over staged files: lint + typecheck, and tests on staged risk files. |
| Run heavier checks before code leaves the machine | Pre-push: full typecheck or a broader test set. Anything too slow for per-edit moves here. |
| Decide where a given gate belongs | Ask: is it fast enough (a few seconds) for per-edit, or should it wait for commit/push/CI? Slow checks block the agent loop on every edit — push them up a layer. |
| Use the same hook across tools | The trigger → matcher → handler → signal pattern is the same in Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, and Copilot; only the config file and event names change. See the cross-tool table below. |

### Hook lifecycle — the universal pattern

Every tool's hooks follow four steps:

1. **Trigger** — an event in the tool (e.g. the agent just saved a file: `PostToolUse`).
2. **Matcher** — a filter deciding whether this hook runs (tool name like `Write`/`Edit`, file type, or a name pattern).
3. **Handler** — the action that runs, usually a shell command.
4. **Signal** — the result returns to the tool. The exit code says pass/fail; stdout can flow into the agent's context as feedback.

### Exit codes and the feedback loop

- **0** — success; the hook passed, continue.
- **2** — blocking error; the agent sees the feedback and should react.
- **anything else** — non-blocking error; logged, but does not interrupt work.

On a blocking failure, stdout flows into the agent's context (in Claude Code via `additionalContext`, capped at 10,000 characters; other tools have similar mechanisms with their own limits). That is why the agent can self-correct: it sees the concrete message — missing type, unimported module, badly formatted line — not just "something failed".

The boundary: the agent reliably fixes **trivial** corrections on its own. When a test fails because of wrong business logic, the hook surfaces it but the agent may not diagnose the real cause — it says "something is off" and tries a trivial fix. If that does not resolve in one or two tries, the signal comes back to you, and the problem may deserve its own change-id with the full `/10x-new → /10x-research → /10x-plan → /10x-implement` workflow.

### Three local layers (plus CI)

| Layer | Catches | Timing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-edit (agent hooks) | Formatting, simple type errors, failing unit tests on risk files. Only layer that feeds the agent mid-work. | ms–s |
| Pre-commit (git hooks) | What slipped past per-edit: manual edits, files changed outside the hook, checks too slow for per-edit. Operates on staged files. | s |
| Pre-push | Heavier checks before pushing to remote (full typecheck, broader test set). | s–min |
| CI | Integration problems, cross-module dependencies, checks needing infra unavailable locally. | min |

Local layers do **not** replace CI — CI stays the key verification for shared repo state and environments you don't control. But each local layer that catches an error is one fewer CI round-trip. You don't need all layers from day one: start with one per-edit hook (lint) and one commit gate, add layers as you see what escapes. The quality gates in `test-plan.md §4` decide which checks are worth automating and when; a plan may legitimately defer per-edit hooks if the cost/signal ratio isn't there yet.

### Key rules

- Keep per-edit hooks fast. If a check takes more than a few seconds, move it to commit, push, or CI — a slow per-edit hook blocks the agent loop on every edit. Lint/format are ideal per-edit; full typecheck is often a commit gate in larger projects.
- Run scoped tests, not the whole suite, per edit — only tests related to the edited file, and only when that file is a risk area in `test-plan.md`.
- `related` is a subcommand, not a flag (`vitest related`, not `--related`). Use `--run` so the hook terminates instead of entering watch mode.
- `PostToolUse` fires once per tool use; three edits in one turn fire it three times independently — there is no built-in aggregation.
- The git hook tool (Lefthook vs Husky+lint-staged) is an implementation detail; the rule is the same — run checks on staged files before commit. If Husky already works, don't migrate.
- **Context injection is not universal.** Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and Copilot (in VS Code) can pass a hook's result to the agent; Windsurf cannot — it can block (exit 2) but can't tell the agent what went wrong.

### The same pattern in every tool

| Tool | Events | Handlers | Context injection | Config |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | ~30 | command, http, mcp_tool, prompt, agent | yes | `.claude/settings.json` |
| Cursor | ~18 | command, prompt | yes | `.cursor/hooks.json` |
| Codex | 10 | command | yes | `.codex/hooks.json` |
| Windsurf | 12 | command | **no** | `.windsurf/hooks.json` |
| Copilot | ~13 | command, http, prompt | yes (VS Code) | `.github/hooks/*.json` |

### Lesson boundaries

- This lesson configures hooks and local quality layers only. The hook JSON, `lefthook.yml`, and the per-edit/commit/push layering are the scope.
- Do not write E2E tests, configure Playwright/MCP, or run browser scenarios. That is Lesson 4.
- Do not run the bug-to-fix-to-regression-test debugging workflow. That is Lesson 5.
- Do not change the risk strategy or quality-gate definitions. That is Lesson 1 (`/10x-test-plan`); read current state with `/10x-test-plan --status`.
- Do not write unit/integration test code from scratch here. That is Lesson 2 — hooks only *run* the tests those lessons produced.
- Do not author CI/CD pipelines. That is Module 1 Lesson 5 / Module 2 Lesson 5; hooks are the local layers in front of CI.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `.claude/settings.json` — hook configuration (`~/.claude/settings.json` global, `.claude/settings.json` project, `.claude/settings.local.json` local overrides). Other tools use their own config file (see the table).
- `lefthook.yml` — pre-commit git hook config (lint + typecheck + tests on `{staged_files}`).
- `context/foundation/test-plan.md` — §4 quality gates decide which checks to automate and at which layer; risk areas decide which edits warrant scoped tests.
